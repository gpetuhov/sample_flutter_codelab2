# sample_flutter_codelab2
Learning Flutter basics with the second Flutter Codelab.

## Notes
* Flutter Plugin doesn't work on Android Studio Canary versions
* If Android Studio can't find Dart SDK then provide path to it in Settings: path_to_flutter_folder/bin/cache/dart-sdk
* To format text (if needed): Right-click the dart code and select Reformat Code with dartfmt
* To add external packages: edit pubspec.yaml file and click Packages get and import package in main.dart
